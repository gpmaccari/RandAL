Sample datasets for testing RandAL
----------------------------------

/genomes: store two reference genomes.
        /Staphylococcus.fasta (bacterium, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/Taxon:663951)
        /Drosophila melanogaster chromosome 3R.fasta (eukaryote, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AE014297)
Genomes are taken from EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk). Users also can find reference genomes at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

/reads: store simulated reads for above genomes.
        /Staphylococcus: simulated reads for Staphylococcus.
        /DrosophilaeR: simulated reads for Drosophila melanogaster chromosome 3R.
Reads are generated with a simulator named wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim). 100,000 reads with length from 35bps to 400bps are generated with default settings. See https://github.com/lh3/wgsim for detailed information on how to generate simulated reads and evaluate the alignment results.
